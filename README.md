LaunchPad
=========

A decentralized Nodejs workflow tool used to manage software on any server.

Launchpad is a tool that can be used to run any task on any clutser of machines virtual or physical. Examples can be as complex as configuring an enterprise weblogic cluster on a specific set of hosts or as simple as updating personal ssh keys. Think of it as a personal Puppet or Chef without the overhead. The only requirement for LaunchPad is an ssh login on a host you are using or managing. LaunchPad creates an agent that allows you to remotely execute and deliver files. Launchpad and its agents are operated through a simple web interface. The most important benefit of LaunchPad is the knowledge is retained and processes are repeatable. Once a workflow is set up it should be repeatable on any environment.
